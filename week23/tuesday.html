<a class="anchor" name="anchor-0"></a>9:00 am Hiring day prep</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Per the email we sent out yesterday, if you want to participate in hiring day, you must take part in the pre-hiring day sessions today and tomorrow. </p></li>
<li><p>We will be doing dry runs through all presentations today at 3pm.  </p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, one of your goals should be that anyone should be able to use your app and interact with it.  If you're the only person who can demo your app, then you're limiting the impact of your work.  When people can't figure out what to press , where things are, how it works, or which 'magical' data needs to be entered into form fields to make things work, it shows that your app has a low UX score, and that you may not think about users in your development process. </p></li>
<li><p>Tomorrow, we will do a full dress rehearsal with James </p></li>
