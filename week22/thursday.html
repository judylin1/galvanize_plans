<ul>
<li>We need a deployed master branch by the end of the calendar day this Friday.  We understand that many of you will be doing a big code push this weekend, and that's fine.  But by Friday, we need to be able to get from you a "best working thing that I have as of now" release. This release will be the fallback for your presentation. </li>
<li>Monday at 11:59 pm , we will be implementing a code freeze.  No more work can be done on your projects by that time, and your newest work should be pushed to a staging branch.  This way you have a master from Friday  and a staging from Monday.  If staging WORKS and is better than master, you can always opt to demo your staging branch at Capstones.  However, master will have been vetted by instructors and is a fallback in case there is any unforeseen glitch in your staging push when you are doing presentations. </li>
