<h1>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-1"></a>Tic-tac-toe</h1>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-2"></a>Objectives</h2>

<p>This is a combination Cognitive and Non-Cognitive exercise.  </p>

<p>On the <strong>cognitive</strong> side your goal is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reason your way through each problem, engaging your "slow thinking" brain</li>
</ul><p>On the <strong>non-cognitive</strong> side your goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>To "wrestle with it", and have some fun!  Don't be afraid to take risks and break things.  It's only code :)</li>
<li>To be an effective pair

<ul>
<li>Favor equal driving time to being a keyboard hog</li>
<li>Favor suggestions ("what if...") over declarations ("we should...")</li>
<li>Favor leading your pair to a solution (non-leading questions) over assuming the role of a teacher / lecturer</li>
<li>Favor having an awesome <em>process</em> of pairing / debugging / being methodical, over just having a working <em>product</em> (no need to rush)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To be disciplined about keeping track of the challenges you are encountering</li>
</ul><h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-3"></a>Exercise</h2>

<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a fully functioning tic-tac-toe board in javascript and CSS that can be playable by two people at the same computer.</p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-4"></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>Users should see a 3x3 grid on the screen.</p>

<p>When a user clicks an empty cell, it should place an X in the cell.  When a user clicks another empty cell, it should place a Y in the cell and it should alternate back and forth until the game is over.</p>

<p>When a user clicks in a cell that's already populated, nothing should happen.</p>

<p>When a winning move is played, show an <code>alert</code> that displays the winning player in the modal. After clicking OK, a new game should start.</p>

<p>When a game move is made that casts the game to a draw, show an <code>alert</code> that displays "Draw", and reset the game after the user clicks "OK".</p>

<p>Use CSS and client-side javascript to make this happen.</p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-5"></a>Break it down</h2>

<ul>
<li>What questions do you have?</li>
<li>Break the problem down - what smaller problems will you need to solve?</li>
<li>What don't you know?  What technical issues do you think you'll have to review / lookup?</li>
</ul><h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-6"></a>Build it</h2>

<p>Work in pairs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Straight HTML + JavaScript files are OK, or you could build an Express app and practice that more</li>
<li>jQuery / pure JavaScript / any JavaScript framework - all OK</li>
<li>Hand-rolled CSS / Foundation / Bootstrap - all OK</li>
</ul><h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-7"></a>Reflect</h2>

<ul>
<li>What problems did you encounter that you didn't anticipate?</li>
<li>On the learn-to-learn skills (setting the stage, playing), how did you do?</li>
<li>What new questions do you have now that you've done this exercise?</li>
</ul><h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-8"></a>Stretch it out!</h2>

<p>Instead of having two people play at the same computer, make it so that the computer can play you!</p>

<p>To start, have your algorithm just pick a random spot.  Then evolve your algorithm until your code uses optimal game play.  For example, your code would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Favor a winning move if there is one</li>
<li>Favor blocking your opponent if possible</li>
</ul><p>Shit gets deep very quickly :)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kFKnB6JtcY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kFKnB6JtcY</a></p>
