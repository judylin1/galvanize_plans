<p>You can now see what we see about your progress: Class Work &gt; Performance</p>

<ul>
<li>We're about 10% there on filling things in historically</li>
<li>We're about 60% there on having content there and available, but we are lacking some organization</li>
<li>We still have a TON of rails standards / objectives, some of which we will be smallifying</li>
<li>We are missing some of the angular stuff, but we'll be filling that in soon</li>
</ul><p>The goal is to give you complete visibility into both what's next, where you are and to stop </p>
