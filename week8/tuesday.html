<h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-3"></a>Authorization</h2>

<p>Some notable quotes:</p>

<p>From Derek B:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can be compared to airport; authentication is the TSA agent checking your id to make sure you are who you say you are, whereas authorization is the person at the gate presumes you've already been authenticated by the TSA agent and just has to authorize whether or not your ticket garners you access to that specific flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Jaylyn:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Authorization is handled with middleware with router.use() and router.get() or .post(), along with the "next" and "err" parameters that render different pages if certain criteria are met (or not met).</p>

<p>You can install third-party middleware in addition to your own with npm install and app.use().</p>

<p>Authorization != authentication: "authentication is knowing who an entity is, while authorization is knowing what a given entity can do." </p>

<p>There are a LOT of ways to mess it up: <a href="http://www.toptal.com/security/10-most-common-web-security-vulnerabilities">http://www.toptal.com/security/10-most-common-web-security-vulnerabilities</a></p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-4"></a>Middleware Objectives</h2>

<p>By the end of this lesson you should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use application-level middleware to set locals that will be available to all view templates</li>
<li>Use application-level middleware to redirect all unauthenticated requests to all routes that appear "after" that middleware</li>
<li>Use router-level middleware to redirect all unauthorized requests to all routes that use that middleware</li>
<li>Describe what Express middleware is and how <code>next()</code> works</li>
<li>Draw a middleware chain when given an express app (including both application-level and route-level middleware)</li>
<li>Describe what the <code>body-parser</code> and <code>cookie-parser</code> middleware do</li>
</ul><p>Guiding questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What does <code>next</code> do?</li>
<li>What happens if you don't call it?</li>
<li>Does order matter when adding middleware?  Why or why not?</li>
<li>What is the difference between a route and middleware?</li>
</ul><h3>
