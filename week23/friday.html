<p>Thank you to everyone who participated in hiring day yesterday.  Nmuta is here doing a few 1:1s and  some planning and collaboration work today. You're free to come in if you want, but today is a day for some down time after Capstone presentations. Hopefully we'll see you at the cookout tomorrow. </p>
