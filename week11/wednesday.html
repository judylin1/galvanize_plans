<p>If folks could bring laptops to follow along on the labs, that would be awesome. Here are the labs that they will be working on. </p>

<p><strong>Lab #1 - Personalized Recommendations</strong></p>

<p>Uses Concept Insights, Tradeoff Analytics, and QA (on the travel corpus) to take users through a simple app that recommends travel locations based on concepts they search for (and uses Tradeoff Analytics to let them compare these locations based on parameters such as travel distance, cost, population density)</p>

<p><strong>Lab #2 - Conversational Insights</strong></p>

<p>Uses Twitter API, Personality Insights, and Tone Analyzer to take users through an app where you enter a twitter ID and get personality traits, as well as an analysis of the tone you are using to write a message towards that person</p>

<p><strong>Lab #3 - Image Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Uses Alchemy Vision, Text to Speech, and Machine Translation to take users through an app that can recognize an image, gives a text identification of that image, and then translates that text into Spanish (think of this as a simple public assistance app). We built it to render as a mobile webpage so it can run through a browser or the app can be accessed on a mobile phone and will use the phone's camera to source the picture (pretty cool!)</p>
