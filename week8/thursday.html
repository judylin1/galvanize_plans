<a class="anchor" name="anchor-0"></a>OAuth and Passport JS</h1>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-1"></a>OAuth</h2>

<p>Objectives:</p>

<p>By the end of today you should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Describe and explain OAuth and it's role in web authentication</li>
<li>Install and configure Passport (npm install, ensuring it's in package.json, configuring middleware, adding .env etc...)</li>
<li>Install and configure a Passport strategy (for today, it'll be LinkedIn)</li>
<li>Take advantage of being logged in to LinkedIn to make user-specific API calls to LinkedIn</li>
</ul><h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-2"></a>Discussion</h2>

<p>We'll just be covering OAuth 2 for the Web.  There are lots of other OAuth-related things, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>OAuth 1.x (way more complex and difficult to work with)</li>
<li>OAuth for mobile devices and scripts</li>
<li>Lots of detailed info here as well: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2</a>
</li>
</ul><p>The basic OAuth2 web flow is:</p>

<p>Guiding questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does Google / Facebook / LinkedIn etc... communicate with your <em>local</em> web app during development?  Isn't that private (aka not published on the internet)??</li>
<li>What part of your existing authentication / authorization flows does this replace?</li>
<li>Why would you want to authenticate with Google / Facebook instead of storing the emails / passwords yourself?</li>
</ul><h2>
<a class="anchor" name="anchor-3"></a>Exercise</h2>

<p>Follow instructions on <a href="https://github.com/gSchool/express-passport-linkedin">https://github.com/gSchool/express-passport-linkedin</a></p>

<p>You will create a new, public repo and push all of your changes there.</p>

<p>When you are done, find an instructor and demo your working application.</p>
