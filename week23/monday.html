<li><p>Capstone review queue:   Per our conversations last week, we need to get a list of all of the production urls for all of the capstones in the class.  All of your development this week needs to be done on a staging branch; the production branch push from this weekend needs to be left alone until a 'better' build is vetted on your staging branch. </p></li>
<li><p>g15 is starting today !  They have some extra curriculars planned, and may be weaving in an out of the basement, but let's all send them some support and sage-like wisdom from g10</p></li>
<li><p>For the current hiring day RSVPs, slack Nmuta</p></li>
<li><p>If you have already been hired, you should not participate in hiring day ( I know it sounds obvious, but we just wanted to clarify that here ) . </p></li>
<li><p>Let's have a great week !   </p></li>
